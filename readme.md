The purpose of this project is to do the Google job when it comes to update their samples accordingly with their docs/releases.

We have an official MediaProjection sample available through the AndroidStudio indexer, but it doesn't show how to use it in the newer Android 14 (and its security mechanisms changes).

Enjoy it, because I spent almost two weeks gathering pieces from all over the places until I get this working :'|
